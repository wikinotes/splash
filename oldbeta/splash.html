					<p class="leading">We've outgrown our humble MediaWiki-based roots and are working around the clock to bring to you a brand new, custom-written platform developed specifically with WikiNotes in mind.</p>
					<p class="leading">Stay up to date on our progress by following <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wikinotes_ca">@wikinotes_ca</a> on Twitter.</p>
					<h2>What does this mean for me? &raquo;</h2>
					<p>Only good things, we promise. Contributing content will become easier than ever, resulting in more collaboration and higher-quality course materials. You'll be able to watch the courses you're in and stay informed of new and updated pages. Furthermore, since the development and design are being in-housed, we won't be incurring any costs that we might want to pass on to our visitors -- wikinotes will remain the openly accessible, advertisement-free wiki you all know and love.</p>
					<h2>How soon is soon? &raquo;</h2>
					<p>We're hoping to announce a public beta sometime in early November. All the content on the main site will remain as-is, and we'll slowly begin replicating all the content over at http://beta.wikinotes.ca. Feel free to play around with the beta once it's announced and let us know through <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wikinotes_ca" title="@wikinotes_ca">twitter</a>, <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wikinotes" title="#wikinotes on freenode">IRC</a> or email at admin@wikinotes.ca if you notice anything broken. Once we've worked out the kinks and finished replicating the content, we'll move all our changes over to the main site and point all the old URLs to an archived version of the MediaWiki installation.</p>
					<h2>How can I help? &raquo;</h2>
					<p>Interested in contributing to the development? Love working with Django, GitHub and open source? Head over heels for clean code or pretty icons? We'd love you have you on board. Take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/dellsystem/wikinotes/wiki">development wiki</a> to get a feel for how the project works, and if you see any <a href="https://github.com/dellsystem/wikinotes/issues">open issues</a> that you want to try your hand at fixing, feel free to <a href=https://github.com/dellsystem/wikinotes">fork away</a>. Alternatively, contact our lead developer (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dellsystem">@dellsystem</a> on Twitter, and ilostwaldo@gmail.com by email) if you want to find out more about what needs to be done and how you can contribute. Developers, designers and testers are all welcome.</p>
